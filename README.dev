This is a development release, so the new features are not documented
very good yet. In fact, most of the documentation (especially in the
doc/ directory) refers to old versions and often is PLAIN WRONG.

* New action model *

In this development version a new action model is introduced. The new
model is more flexible and should be easier to understand
(e.g. 'shift' is not needed any more, the requested 'triggers' work).

See examples/joydrc.NEW for a working joydrc file. The new
configuration file format is also described there.

* BSD port *

Vincent Bernat <bernat@free.fr> has done a port to OpenBSD. It should
also work on NetBSD and FreeBSD. I've included the patches and changed
the autoconf routine a bit.

After that, I've completely changed the action model (see above). I've
also tried to make joyreadbutton and joyreadaxis to work under
BSD. The result is that I've totally messed up the fine BSD work of
Vincent - I don't think it will run out of the box any more. But
that's just fine because the main purpose of this release is to ask
him if the BSD port still works ;-)
